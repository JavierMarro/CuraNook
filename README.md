# Welcome to CuraNook

## Project Overview

CuraNook is a platform where users can explore virtual exhibitions from combined collections of antiquities and fine art from The Metropolitan Museum and Harvard Art Museums. This platform is aimed for researchers, students, and art enthusiasts, providing a searchable and interactive experience of the collections.

## Initial wireframe, user stories and component tree

## Web Data

As of now, this Web App has been created thanks to two institutions making their APIs accessible to the public. The data is fetched from:

- Harvard Art Museums API (https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/api)
- The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API (https://metmuseum.github.io/)

In the short term, the idea is to integrate even more APIs to grant users a wider variety of artwork for their own personal exhibition collections (such as The Fitzwilliam Museum Collections API and The Victoria and Albert Collections API)
