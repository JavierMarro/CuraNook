## Project Overview

CuraNook is a platform where users can explore virtual exhibitions from combined collections of antiquities and fine art from The Metropolitan Museum and Harvard Art Museums and create their own personalised lists. This platform is aimed for researchers, students, and art enthusiasts, providing a searchable and interactive experience of the collections.

## Getting Started

#### Text Editor

```shell
Visual Studio Code
```

#### Technologies

```shell
HTML5
```

```shell
Tailwind
```

```shell
JAVASCRIPT
```

```shell
REACT
```

```shell
TanStack
```

```shell
Typescript
```

```shell
Aceternity
```

## Web Data

As of now, this Web App has been created thanks to two institutions making their APIs accessible to the public. The data is fetched from:

1. Harvard Art Museums API (https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/api)
2. The Art Institute of Chicago API (https://api.artic.edu/docs/)

In the short term, the idea is to integrate even more APIs to grant users a wider variety of artwork for their own personal exhibition collections (such as The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API and The Victoria and Albert Collections API)
